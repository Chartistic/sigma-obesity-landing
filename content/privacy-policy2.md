### Pre‑launch notice
*The Service is not yet available in Poland. This page is provided for informational purposes only. These terms/policies will take effect on the public launch date.*

**Last updated:** September 8, 2025  
**Controller:** **Sigma Clinic sp. z o.o.**, Młynarska 42, 01-171 Warszawa, Poland • **support@sigma.clinic**  
**(If appointed) Data Protection Officer:** [NAME / CONTACT]

## 1) Data We Process
- **Identification & contact:** name, email, **mobile phone**, address, PESEL (if required by law).  
- **Health-related information:** information you provide to physicians; physician-generated documentation (e.g., notes; documentation where applicable).  
- **Account & usage:** account ID, device/browser details, IP, timestamps, logs, in-app **chat messages**.  
- **Payments:** transaction metadata via **Stripe/PayU** (we **do not** store full card numbers).  
- **Technical identifiers:** **JWT authentication tokens** in **browser localStorage** (not cookies) to keep you signed in; persist until logout or token expiry.  
- **SMS data:** mobile number and delivery metadata (time, status) to send **one-time login codes** and **service notifications**.  
- **Cookies & trackers:** listed in the dynamic **Cookie Declaration** (Cookiebot) on this page.

## 2) Sources
You; your physician; automated collection from your device during use.

## 3) Purposes & Legal Bases
- **Provide the Service** (account, secure information exchange, notifications, documentation where applicable):  
  - GDPR **Art. 6(1)(b)** (contract) and **Art. 9(2)(h)** (health-care purposes under professional responsibility).  
- **Authentication & security** (e.g., **SMS one-time codes** for login, fraud prevention, logs): **Art. 6(1)(b)** and **6(1)(f)**.  
- **Communications** (chat, **service SMS**, notification emails): **Art. 6(1)(b)/(f)**.  
- **Payments & invoicing:** **Art. 6(1)(b)/(c)**.  
- **Analytics/advertising cookies** on public pages (e.g., Google Analytics/Ads, Meta, TikTok, Microsoft Ads/LinkedIn): **Art. 6(1)(a)** (consent) + ePrivacy; blocked until you consent via Cookiebot.  
- **Marketing communications (if used):** **Art. 6(1)(a)** (separate opt-in; withdraw anytime).

**Note on e-prescription notifications in Poland:** When a physician issues an e-prescription via the national e-health system, patients typically receive a **4-digit access code by SMS** (or email/app) and present it with **PESEL** at the pharmacy; this SMS is sent by the **state system**, not us. We may display related information or send service reminders where technically enabled.

## 4) Is Data Required?
Providing identification and certain health data is **contractually necessary**. If you do not provide it, **we cannot deliver the Service**.

## 5) Recipients (Categories)
- **Physicians** providing services to you.  
- **Processors** acting on our instructions: EU cloud hosting (**data stored in the EU; encrypted at rest**), email/chat delivery, **SMS gateway** (for service SMS), **Stripe/PayU**, analytics/ads vendors **only with your consent**, security/CDN (if implemented).  
- **Public authorities** where required by law.  
We **do not** sell personal data and **do not** share patient data with insurers or unrelated third parties.

## 6) International Transfers
Some vendors (e.g., an SMS gateway) may process data outside the EEA. Where applicable, we use **Standard Contractual Clauses** and additional safeguards; details on request.

## 7) Retention
- **Medical documentation (where we host/hold it):** retained **as required by Polish law**—generally **20 years** from the end of the year of the last entry; **30 years** for death due to injury/poisoning; **10 years** for standalone X-rays; **5 years** for referrals/orders (2 years if not performed and referral not collected); **22 years** for records of children under 2.  
- **Account & operational data:** for the life of the account and for statutory limitation/audit periods.  
- **Marketing data:** until you withdraw consent.  
- **Security logs, SMS delivery logs & tokens:** minimal periods required for security/operations; **JWT** until logout or token expiry.
