We collect information about your device and internet connection, including IP address and any other data you provide, such as name, email address, and phone number. We may combine this data with information about your activities on our website, including all information you provide.

We collect data to provide services, analyse website traffic, display relevant advertisements, and send marketing information. Your data may be shared with service providers we use to fulfill our obligations.

In line with Google’s data processing principles for Consent Mode, and Google’s use of information policy, we send information about requests to our server to Google. Based on this data, in a way that prevents user identification, an approximate adjustment of traffic measurements on our site is made to partially compensate for the measurement distortion resulting from honouring user refusals to process their data.

Some service providers (e.g., Google, Meta) may store data outside the European Economic Area. In our assessment, these providers offer a guarantee of data protection through compliance mechanisms as required by applicable law.

Depending on the data processing purpose, we retain data:

- Until you withdraw your consent (newsletter, other subscriptions)  
- Until objection to the processing of their personal data is recognized (contact form, email)  
- For a period not exceeding 25 months from your last interaction with our website (other data)

Cookies are small text files that can be used by websites to make a user's experience more efficient. This site uses different types of cookies. Some cookies are placed by third party services that appear on our pages.

Cookies are small data files stored in your browser used to identify your device, using anonymous identifiers (text strings). Some cookies are necessary and some features of our website may not work correctly without these cookies. Some other cookies are used for personalisation, analytics, or advertising purposes. The law states that for some types of cookies we may need your consent. We may also use similar, cookieless technologies. Your consent, if given, will also cover its use.

You can at any time change or withdraw your consent by clicking the **“Manage cookies”** link in the footer of our website, as well as in our **Privacy Policy**, where you can also learn more about who we are, how you can contact us, and how we process personal data.

You can remove all cookies from your browser at any time. You can also block cookies in your browser or use private browsing mode (incognito). You can find out how to do it in your browser's help.
